    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We make this Chile Colorado for my Mexican husband, who also doesn't like tomatoes in his chile. This is a
        traditional Mexican-style dish. If you decide to add beans, do it after the chile is finished. Serve with
        chopped onion, sliced green onion, shredded Cheddar cheese, and sour cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 New Mexico dry chiles - washed, with stems and seeds removed</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>5 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed of fat</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cups beef stock, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place chiles and 3 cups water into a medium stockpot, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and steep for 30
            minutes to soften.</li>
        <li>Strain into a bowl, reserving the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Place chiles and some of the liquid into a blender, and purée until smooth. Add more liquid as necessary to
            form a smooth sauce.</li>
        <li>Pass sauce through a fine mesh strainer to remove any seeds or tough skins; set aside.</li>
        <li>Cut beef into 1- to 2-inch chunks. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Dredge beef chunks in
            the seasoned flour; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Sauté onion until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add beef chunks a few at a time, so as not to overcrowd the pot, and cook until evenly brown. Remove seared
            meat, and continue browning the remaining meat. Return reserved seared meat to the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in puréed chile mixture. Add beef stock just to cover beef chunks, or to personal preference. Bring to
            a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to lowest setting, and simmer for 3 hours, or until meat is tender. If
            necessary, adjust with more stock during cooking.</li>
    </ol>
